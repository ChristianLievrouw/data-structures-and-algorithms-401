Insertion Sort
Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code

On the first go through i is set to the length of the array passed in minus 1. Then the next line runs and sees if the 1st position in the array is less then the 0 position and if it is it swaps them and continues. Then the 2nd position is checked against the 1st if it is less then the second then it moves and checks position 0.
